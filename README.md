# demo-elman-1990

here's a qualitatively replication of [1] -- by the end of training, the model's prediction error peaks right after word/event boundaries.  

`rnn_pnl_sl.ipynb` uses <a href="https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/">psyneulink</a> (tested on the `psyneulink/devel`, 02/17/2019) and `rnn_sl.ipynb` uses pytroch
these two versions are not meant to be quantitatively matched
